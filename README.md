# Machine Learning Capstone Projects

## Project 1 - The Automated Book Categorization (ABC) Helper 
Data has been uploaded: summaries and titles are included in the data. Data came from multiple sources. 
- Kaggle - all csv files
- Google Books - apis in python file


Please see the following for how data was collected: [Project_1_Python_File](Project_1_Library/16.4%20Collecting_Book_Data.ipynb)

Total Count of Samples: 1,449,541

Upload using LFS objects. Please see LFS code section at the bottom of the page. 


## Project 2 - The Diatom Identifier 
Data has been uploaded: diatom images including annotations and outlines. Data came from multiple sources.
- Kaggle - Diatom folder was downloaded with over 4K samples
- Diatoms.org - Images were manually pulled and relabeled from this website in order to preserve the genus/species of the diatom image.
- Outlines were created by data gatherer for genus types needing more images in order to recognize the overall shape of the diatom. 

ALERT: There were many failures uploading images from Kaggle file. 
In order to see the data, please go to https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/huseyingunduz/diatom-dataset and download zip. Replace file 'images' with that inside zip and uncomment code to run. (Hard-coded number images in file)

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("huseyingunduz/diatom-dataset")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)`
